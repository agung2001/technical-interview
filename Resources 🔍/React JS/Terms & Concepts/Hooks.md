[ALL React Hooks Explained in 12 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOH1l-MP_9k)

**React Hooks** are functions that let you use **state** and **other React features** in **functional components**. Before hooks were introduced in React 16.8, functional components were stateless and could only be used for rendering UI. However, hooks allow functional components to manage state, handle side effects, and use other React features that were previously only available in class components.

Hooks provide a simpler and cleaner way to write and manage components, making it easier to compose functionality and share logic across components.

## **Why Hooks?**
Prior to hooks, managing state and side effects in React required class components. Class components have some boilerplate code, which can be harder to maintain and understand, especially for simple components. With hooks, you can now use state and lifecycle features in functional components, reducing the complexity of the code.

## **Why React Hooks?**
Before hooks, React only allowed state and side effects in class components. With the introduction of hooks in React 16.8, functional components can now manage state and handle side effects, making them more powerful and flexible.
- **Simplicity**: Hooks allow you to use state and other features in functional components without the need for class-based components.
- **Code Reusability**: With hooks like `useEffect` and `useReducer`, itâ€™s easier to share logic between components and improve the structure of your code.
- **Cleaner Code**: Hooks simplify component logic, especially when dealing with complex state logic or side effects.    
- **Avoiding Class Components**: Hooks make it easier to work with functional components and avoid the complexities of class components, such as `this` keyword and lifecycle methods.
