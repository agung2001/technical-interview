Zustand is a state management library for React applications. It is a simple and lightweight alternative to more complex state management libraries like Redux or MobX. Zustand provides a simple API for creating and managing state in React components using the React Hooks API.

Some key features of Zustand include:
1. Minimalistic API: Zustand has a minimalistic and easy-to-use API, making it quick to set up and start using in your React applications.
2. Immutability: Zustand uses Immer under the hood, which allows you to update the state immutably with a simple and natural syntax.
3. Atomic Updates: Zustand supports atomic updates, meaning that you can update multiple state properties in a single operation, which helps avoid potential race conditions and keeps the state consistent.
4. Hooks Integration: Zustand is designed to work seamlessly with React Hooks, allowing you to use it in functional components without the need for any additional setup.
5. Performance: Zustand is built to be performant, and its use of Immer and optimized update mechanisms helps to ensure efficient state updates and rendering.
