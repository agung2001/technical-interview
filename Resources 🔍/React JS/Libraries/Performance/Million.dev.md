"Million.js" is a JavaScript library designed to optimize the rendering performance of large lists or tables in web applications. It is specifically focused on improving performance by minimizing reflows and repaints when displaying large amounts of data.

The library provides a method to efficiently render and update virtualized lists, reducing the number of DOM elements that need to be rendered at any given time. This results in improved performance, especially in cases where you are working with long lists or tables, which can otherwise cause slowdowns in the user interface.

Essentially, Million.js leverages the concept of "virtual DOM" to render only the visible portion of the list, with the remainder of the items being dynamically loaded and rendered as the user scrolls, making it a powerful tool for performance optimization in web development.
