PNPM is a package manager for JavaScript and Node.js projects. It stands for "Performant Node Package Manager." Similar to npm (Node Package Manager) and Yarn, PNPM is used to manage and install packages and dependencies required by your JavaScript projects. However, PNPM has some unique characteristics that set it apart from the others.

Key features of PNPM include:
1. **Space Efficiency:** One of the main differences between PNPM and other package managers is its approach to managing dependencies. PNPM uses a shared package store, which means that common dependencies are stored only once on your disk, reducing the amount of disk space used by your projects.
2. **Faster Installations:** Due to the shared package store and its approach to linking packages, PNPM installations tend to be faster compared to npm and Yarn.
3. **Flat Node Modules:** PNPM uses a "flat node modules" structure, meaning that all the dependencies for your project are stored in a single location, reducing the depth of nested node_modules directories.
4. **Deterministic:** Similar to npm and Yarn, PNPM uses a lockfile to ensure deterministic builds, which helps in ensuring that your project's dependencies remain consistent across different environments.
5. **Parallel Execution:** PNPM can perform many operations in parallel, leading to faster installations and updates.
6. **Zero Disk Space Deduplication:** Unlike npm and Yarn, PNPM doesn't require disk space deduplication as it stores common dependencies only once in a global store.
7. **Backward Compatibility:** PNPM is designed to be backward compatible with npm and Yarn, meaning you can switch between these package managers if needed.

PNPM has gained popularity among developers looking for faster and more space-efficient alternatives to traditional package managers. It's important to note that while PNPM offers advantages in certain scenarios, choosing a package manager depends on your project's needs and your team's preferences.
