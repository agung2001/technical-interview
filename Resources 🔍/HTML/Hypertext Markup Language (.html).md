Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. It defines the structure and layout of a web document by using a system of tags and attributes to describe the content of the page. HTML documents are interpreted by web browsers to display text, images, multimedia, and interactive elements to users.

HTML documents consist of a hierarchy of elements, each represented by opening and closing tags. These tags define the structure of the document and indicate how elements should be displayed on the web page. For example, the `<head>` tag contains meta-information about the document, such as its title and links to external resources, while the `<body>` tag contains the main content of the page.

HTML also supports the use of attributes within tags to provide additional information or functionality. Attributes can specify properties such as the style, size, or behavior of elements on the page.

HTML is often used in conjunction with other web technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling and layout, and JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. Together, these technologies form the foundation of the World Wide Web and enable the creation of rich and interactive web experiences.
