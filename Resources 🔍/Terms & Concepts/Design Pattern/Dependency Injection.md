Dependency injection is a design pattern and a technique used in software development to achieve loose coupling between different components or modules of an application. It allows components to be independent of each other's concrete implementations, making the code more maintainable, flexible, and testable.

In dependency injection, instead of a component creating its dependencies directly, it receives them from an external source. The external source, often referred to as the "container" or "injector," is responsible for creating and providing the required dependencies to the components that need them.

There are typically three types of dependency injection:
1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are provided to a component through its constructor. The component declares its required dependencies as parameters in the constructor, and the container resolves and injects them when the component is instantiated.
2. Property Injection: Dependencies are provided to a component through public properties. The component declares its dependencies as properties, and the container sets those properties with the appropriate instances after the component is created.
3. Method Injection: Dependencies are provided to a component through methods. The component declares methods that take dependencies as parameters, and the container injects the dependencies when the method is called.

Benefits of Dependency Injection:
1. Decoupling: Components do not need to be aware of how their dependencies are created. They can focus on their primary functionality without worrying about the details of dependency creation.
2. Reusability: Components can be easily reused in different contexts because their dependencies can be replaced or modified by the container.
3. Testability: Components can be easily unit tested by providing mock or fake implementations of their dependencies during testing.
4. Maintainability: The code becomes more maintainable and easier to understand because the dependencies are managed externally, and the component's code remains clean and focused.

Dependency injection is a fundamental concept in many modern software frameworks and languages, including Angular (JavaScript/TypeScript), Spring (Java), and .NET Core (C#). It promotes best practices for creating modular, scalable, and extensible applications.
