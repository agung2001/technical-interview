MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, which is a software architectural pattern used for organizing and designing applications. It separates the application logic into three interconnected components:

1. Model: The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It is responsible for managing the data, processing it, and enforcing the rules and constraints of the application. The Model does not directly interact with the user interface but instead provides an interface for the other components to access and manipulate the data.
2. View: The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user and handling user interactions. It represents the user interface and displays the data from the Model to the user. The View is typically passive and does not contain any business logic; it only focuses on how the data is presented and how the user can interact with it.
3. Controller: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View, processes it, and updates the Model accordingly. It also fetches data from the Model and updates the View to display the updated data. The Controller is responsible for managing the flow of data and user interactions within the application.

The MVC pattern promotes a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain, modify, and extend the application. It allows for better code organization, reusability, and testability. Many modern web frameworks and application architectures are built on the MVC pattern, as it provides a robust and scalable structure for developing complex applications.
