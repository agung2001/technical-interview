DRY stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself" and is a principle of software development that aims to reduce redundancy and repetition in code. The DRY principle states that each piece of information should have a single, unambiguous representation within a system.

The idea behind the DRY principle is that when code is repeated throughout a system, it can become difficult to maintain and update. Any changes to the repeated code must be made in multiple places, which can lead to errors and inconsistencies. By avoiding repetition and ensuring that each piece of information has a single representation, code becomes easier to maintain, update, and extend over time.

The DRY principle can be applied at various levels of software development, from individual lines of code to entire systems. It encourages developers to write code that is modular, reusable, and organized, so that it can be easily maintained and adapted as the system evolves.

In summary, the DRY principle emphasizes the importance of writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code that minimizes redundancy and promotes reusability.
