Regression testing is a type of software testing that is performed to verify that previously developed and tested software still performs as expected after changes. If not, that would be called a regression. Changes that may require regression testing include bug fixes, software enhancements, configuration changes, and even substitution of electronic components. As regression test suites tend to grow with each found defect, test automation is frequently involved.

Benefits and drawbacks. Regression testing is performed when changes are made to the existing functionality of the software or if there is a bug fix in the software. Regression testing can be achieved through multiple approaches; if a test all approach is followed, it provides certainty that the changes made to the software have not affected the existing functionalities, which are unaltered. In agile software development—where the software development life cycles are very short, resources are scarce, and changes to the software are very frequent—regression testing might introduce a lot of unnecessary overhead.

Here are some of the benefits of regression testing:
- It can help to ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.
- It can help to identify regressions early, before they impact users.
- It can help to improve the overall quality of the software.
- It can help to save time and money by preventing the need to fix regressions later in the development process.

Here are some of the drawbacks of regression testing:
- It can be time-consuming and expensive.
- It can be difficult to maintain a regression test suite as the software changes.
- It can be difficult to identify all potential regressions.

Despite the drawbacks, regression testing is an important part of the software development process. By identifying and fixing regressions early, it can help to ensure that the software is of the highest quality.

Here are some of the most common regression testing techniques:
- **Re-execution:** This is the most basic regression testing technique. It involves re-running the same tests that were run before the changes were made.
- **Data-driven testing:** This technique uses data to drive the tests. The data can be used to generate test cases or to select test cases that are relevant to the changes that have been made.
- **Specification-based testing:** This technique uses the software's specifications to drive the tests. The specifications can be used to generate test cases or to select test cases that are relevant to the changes that have been made.
- **Boundary-value testing:** This technique tests the boundaries of the software's functionality. The boundaries can be tested by using extreme values or by using values that are just outside the expected range.
- **Equivalence partitioning:** This technique divides the software's functionality into equivalence classes. Equivalence classes are groups of inputs that behave the same way. Tests are then written to cover each equivalence class.
- **Decision table testing:** This technique uses a decision table to drive the tests. A decision table is a table that shows all possible combinations of inputs and outputs. Tests are then written to cover all possible combinations.
- **Pairwise testing:** This technique tests all possible pairs of inputs. Pairwise testing is a more efficient way to test the software than testing all possible combinations of inputs.
