**Smoke Testing** is a type of **software testing** that is performed to determine whether the most crucial functions of an application are working properly. It is a **preliminary check** to ensure that the basic functionality of the software is working as expected before proceeding with more in-depth testing, such as functional or regression testing.

The term "smoke testing" originates from hardware testing, where a device was powered on, and if it didn't emit smoke, it was considered "working." Similarly, in software, smoke testing is often referred to as a "sanity check" that verifies whether the application is stable enough for more detailed testing.

### Key Characteristics of Smoke Testing:

1. **Basic Functionality Check**:
    
    - Smoke testing typically focuses on verifying whether the **core features** of the application (such as login, data retrieval, or other critical features) are working correctly.
        
    - It does **not** check for every detail or edge case but ensures that the basic functionality is intact.
        
2. **Quick and Shallow**:
    
    - Smoke testing is usually a **quick** and **high-level** test. It does not go deep into the functionality but ensures that the application can function in a basic sense.
        
    - The goal is to identify any **critical flaws** that would prevent further testing from being carried out.
        
3. **Performed Early in the Testing Cycle**:
    
    - Smoke testing is often done early in the testing process, typically after the build is deployed or after a new feature is added. It helps determine whether the new version or build is stable enough to proceed with further testing.
        
4. **Automated or Manual**:
    
    - Smoke tests can be performed either **manually** or **automatically**, depending on the project and the testing strategy. Automated smoke tests can be part of a continuous integration (CI) pipeline, allowing for fast feedback as new code is deployed.
        
5. **Repetitive Process**:
    
    - Smoke testing is often performed **regularly** with each new build or version of the software. It is an essential part of ensuring that the application remains stable as development progresses.
        

### Why Perform Smoke Testing?

1. **Early Detection of Critical Issues**:
    
    - Smoke testing helps catch major issues early in the development process, ensuring that critical parts of the application are functional. This allows the team to address basic functionality problems before investing time in more detailed testing.
        
2. **Quick Feedback**:
    
    - It provides **quick feedback** on the stability of the build, letting the testing team know if they can proceed with more thorough testing or if they need to address major bugs first.
        
3. **Prevents Wasting Time**:
    
    - Without smoke testing, testers might waste time running detailed tests on a build that has significant, easily identifiable issues that would render more complex testing ineffective.
        
4. **Ensures Build Quality**:
    
    - Smoke testing helps ensure that the latest build is **stable enough** to proceed with further testing and development. This reduces the chances of major errors later in the testing cycle.
        
5. **CI/CD Integration**:
    
    - In continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) workflows, automated smoke testing ensures that new changes don’t break the most important parts of the system, providing fast validation and reducing the risk of introducing errors.

### Example of Smoke Testing:

Let’s say a team is working on an **e-commerce website**. A smoke test might include the following checks:

1. **Home Page**: Check if the home page loads correctly.
    
2. **Login Functionality**: Check if the login page is working and a user can successfully log in.
    
3. **Product Search**: Check if the product search function returns results.
    
4. **Add to Cart**: Verify that items can be added to the shopping cart.
    
5. **Checkout Process**: Check if the checkout page works, and the user can proceed to payment.
    

These tests don't check the detailed features of each page or the entire flow, but they ensure that the most critical parts of the application are functional and that the application is ready for more in-depth testing.

### Smoke Testing vs. Sanity Testing:

Although **smoke testing** and **sanity testing** may sound similar, they are actually different:

- **Smoke Testing**: It is a **preliminary test** that verifies whether the basic, core functionality of the system works. It is typically conducted on a new build and ensures that the system is stable enough for more detailed testing.
    
- **Sanity Testing**: It is a **narrower** and more specific test conducted after receiving a software build to verify whether a particular functionality or bug fix works as expected. Sanity testing is done when there is limited time and the objective is to verify a specific function.
    

### Smoke Testing Process:

1. **Prepare Test Cases**:
    
    - Define a set of **high-level test cases** that focus on the major functionalities and core features of the application.
        
2. **Test the Core Features**:
    
    - Perform tests to check if the **critical functions** (such as login, navigation, or data retrieval) are working.
        
3. **Report Issues**:
    
    - If the basic functionality fails, report the critical issues and notify the development team to fix them. If the smoke test passes, the build is considered stable enough for more extensive testing.
        
4. **Proceed with Further Testing**:
    
    - If the smoke test passes, proceed with more detailed testing, such as functional testing, regression testing, or performance testing.

### Example of Smoke Testing in Practice:

Consider a **web application**:

1. **Build is Deployed**: A new version of the app is deployed to the testing environment.
    
2. **Run Smoke Tests**: A set of high-level tests is executed:
    
    - The homepage loads.
        
    - Users can log in and log out successfully.
        
    - The main navigation works.
        
    - Basic features like the search bar and form submission are operational.
        
3. **Result**:
    
    - If any of these basic features fail, the build is rejected, and the development team fixes the issues.
        
    - If everything works, the build passes the smoke test, and the team proceeds with more in-depth testing like user acceptance testing (UAT) or functional testing.

### Benefits of Smoke Testing:

1. **Early Detection**: Quickly identifies major issues in the core functionality, allowing teams to address them before they block further testing.
    
2. **Faster Feedback**: Provides faster feedback to the development team, letting them know whether the build is ready for more thorough testing.
    
3. **Prevents Wasted Effort**: Ensures that testers don't waste time running detailed tests on a broken or unstable build.
    
4. **Simple and Fast**: Smoke testing is simple to perform and doesn't require extensive test cases, making it a quick process to confirm the build is functional.
    
5. **Reduces Risk**: Helps minimize the risk of proceeding with testing on a build that has serious defects, saving time and resources.

### Conclusion:

**Smoke testing** is a quick and basic type of testing performed to determine if the most critical functionality of an application works as expected. It is typically done at the start of the testing process to verify that the build is stable enough to proceed with more detailed tests. Smoke testing provides a **fast feedback loop**, ensures **basic features work**, and prevents wasting time on testing a build that is fundamentally broken. It's a simple but crucial step in the **software development and testing cycle**.
