Software testing is a process of evaluating and verifying the functionality, performance, and quality of a software system or application. It is an essential part of the software development life cycle and aims to identify defects, errors, or gaps in the software before it is released to users.

The primary objectives of software testing are:
1. Finding defects: The main purpose of testing is to identify defects or bugs in the software. This includes detecting errors in the code, logic flaws, missing functionality, or any other issues that may affect the performance or usability of the software.
2. Validating requirements: Testing ensures that the software meets the specified requirements and performs as expected. It verifies that the software functions correctly, delivers the intended features, and meets user expectations.
3. Ensuring reliability and quality: Testing helps assess the reliability, stability, and quality of the software. It aims to uncover any weaknesses, vulnerabilities, or performance bottlenecks that could impact the overall user experience.
4. Enhancing user satisfaction: Through rigorous testing, software defects can be identified and fixed, leading to a higher-quality product. This ultimately results in improved user satisfaction, as users can rely on a software system that functions as intended and meets their needs.

Software testing can involve various techniques and approaches, including functional testing, performance testing, security testing, usability testing, and more. It often includes the creation of test cases, test scripts, and test environments to simulate different scenarios and validate the software against expected outcomes.

The goal of software testing is to ensure that the software is robust, reliable, and delivers the intended functionality, providing a high-quality product that meets user requirements and expectations.
