In computer programming, a namespace is a container that holds a set of identifiers (such as variables, functions, classes, or other symbols) and provides a way to organize and manage them. It is used to avoid naming conflicts and to group related code elements together.

Namespaces help prevent naming collisions between different parts of a program, especially when libraries or modules from different sources are used together. By placing identifiers within a namespace, you can ensure that they have unique names within that namespace, even if they have the same names in other namespaces.

In various programming languages, namespaces are implemented differently. For example:

- In C++, namespaces are declared using the `namespace` keyword, and identifiers can be accessed using the scope resolution operator `::`.
- In C#, namespaces are used to organize classes and other types, and they are declared using the `namespace` keyword.
- In PHP, namespaces were introduced in PHP 5.3 to help organize classes and functions, and they are declared using the `namespace` keyword.
- In Python, modules provide a similar concept of namespacing, where identifiers within a module are only accessible within that module unless explicitly imported in other modules.

Namespaces provide a way to create a modular and organized code structure, making it easier to understand and maintain larger projects. They are an essential tool for managing code complexity and preventing name clashes in software development.
