**Object-oriented programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which can contain data in the form of **fields** (often known as attributes or properties) and **methods** (functions that define the behavior of the object). The key principles of OOP are:

1. **Encapsulation**: This refers to the bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit or class. It also means restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which is often done by making some attributes private and providing access to them through public methods (getters and setters).
2. **Inheritance**: This allows one class (child or subclass) to inherit the properties and methods from another class (parent or superclass). It promotes code reusability and can help in creating a hierarchical relationship between classes.
3. **Polymorphism**: This allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). For example, a method can be used to process different objects that belong to different subclasses but share a common parent class.
4. **Abstraction**: This involves hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary and relevant parts of an object. It allows a programmer to focus on a simplified view of an object, which enhances code usability and maintainability.

### Benefits of OOP:
- **Modularity**: OOP allows for modular development. Each object can be developed independently, making the system more manageable.
- **Reusability**: Once a class is written, it can be reused across different programs or parts of a program.
- **Maintainability**: Code is easier to maintain because of its modular structure. Changes in one part of the system do not affect other parts significantly.
- **Scalability**: OOP enables the development of scalable systems, as new objects or classes can be easily added.

OOP languages include **Java**, **C++**, **Python**, **C#**, and **Ruby**.
