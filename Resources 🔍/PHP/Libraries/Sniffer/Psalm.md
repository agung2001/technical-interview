Psalm is a static analysis tool for PHP that focuses on providing strict and accurate type inference. It aims to help developers catch and prevent type-related errors in their PHP codebase, ensuring safer and more reliable software.

Key features of Psalm include:
1. Type inference: Psalm performs deep analysis of PHP code to infer and understand types of variables, properties, and function return values. This helps to identify potential type errors early in the development process.
2. Error detection: Psalm checks for various types of errors, such as incorrect type usage, undefined variables, and incorrect function calls.
3. Type annotations: Developers can add custom type annotations to their code to provide additional information for Psalm's analysis.
4. Performance optimization: Psalm is designed to be fast and efficient, making it suitable for use in large codebases.
5. Plugin support: Psalm supports the use of plugins, which allows extending its functionality and adding custom rules.
6. Easy integration: Psalm can be easily integrated into your development workflow, running it as part of your CI/CD pipeline or during local development.

Using Psalm helps PHP developers write more robust and maintainable code by catching potential issues early and enforcing stricter type safety. It is widely used in the PHP community and is often used in combination with other static analysis tools like PHPStan and PHPCS to achieve a higher level of code quality and reliability.
