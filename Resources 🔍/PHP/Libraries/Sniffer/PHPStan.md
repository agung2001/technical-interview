PHPStan is a powerful static code analysis tool for PHP. It performs static analysis on your PHP code without actually running it, which allows it to catch potential errors, bugs, and inconsistencies early in the development process.

PHPStan uses static type checking to infer types and detect type-related issues in your code. It analyzes the entire codebase and checks for issues such as:

1. Type errors, including incorrect method arguments and return types.
2. Undefined variables and properties.
3. Unused variables and parameters.
4. Incorrect access to methods and properties in objects.
5. Violations of coding standards and best practices.

PHPStan is highly customizable, allowing you to set the level of strictness and configure various rules according to your project's needs. It can be integrated into your development workflow, running it as part of your continuous integration process or locally before committing code changes.

Using PHPStan helps to improve the overall code quality, maintainability, and reliability of your PHP applications by catching potential issues before they manifest as runtime errors. It is widely used in modern PHP projects and is considered one of the essential tools for ensuring code quality and correctness.
