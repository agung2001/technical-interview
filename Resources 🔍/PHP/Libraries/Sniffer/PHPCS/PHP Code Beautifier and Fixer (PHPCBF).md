**PHP Code Beautifier and Fixer** (often referred to as **phpcbf**) is a tool that automatically formats and fixes PHP code to adhere to specified coding standards, making the code more readable and consistent. It is often used in conjunction with **PHP CodeSniffer (PHPCS)**, a static analysis tool that detects violations of coding standards.

### Key Features of PHP Code Beautifier and Fixer:
1. **Automatic Code Formatting**: It automatically formats the code to follow a consistent style, such as aligning code indentation, spacing, line breaks, and other formatting rules.
2. **Fixing Coding Standard Violations**: PHP Code Beautifier and Fixer can fix coding standard violations that are identified by PHP CodeSniffer (PHPCS). For example, it can correct:
    - Incorrect indentation
    - Extra or missing spaces
    - Misaligned braces and parentheses
    - Incorrect or inconsistent use of docblocks
    - Line length violations
        
3. **Customization**: Just like PHP CodeSniffer, PHP Code Beautifier and Fixer can be customized to follow different coding standards (like **PSR-2**, **PSR-12**, or custom coding styles). You can specify which rules to follow and apply fixes based on your projectâ€™s requirements.
4. **Integrates with PHPCS**: While PHP CodeSniffer detects violations of coding standards, PHP Code Beautifier and Fixer can be used to automatically correct those violations. It works by fixing issues that PHPCS reports in a codebase.
5. **Command-Line Tool**: It is typically used as a command-line tool, where you can specify the files or directories to be fixed.

### How It Works:
When you run **phpcbf** on a PHP file or project, it scans the code and applies formatting fixes according to the specified coding standards. If there are violations, it attempts to automatically apply the necessary fixes, such as:
- Fixing indentation (e.g., converting tabs to spaces or adjusting the number of spaces).
- Adding or removing whitespace where needed (e.g., around operators, after commas).
- Ensuring consistent line breaks and braces placement.

### Example Usage:
To run PHP Code Beautifier and Fixer on a file or directory, you can use the following command:

```bash
phpcbf /path/to/your/code
```

If you want to fix a single file, you can run:
```bash
phpcbf myfile.php
```

You can also specify coding standards (like **PSR-2**) as an argument:
```bash
phpcbf --standard=PSR2 /path/to/your/code
```

### Benefits:
- **Consistency**: Ensures that your code follows a consistent style, improving readability and maintainability, especially in teams.
- **Efficiency**: Automatically fixes coding standard violations, reducing the time spent manually correcting style issues.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Ensures that all team members follow the same coding standards, avoiding conflicts caused by different coding styles.
- **Quality Assurance**: Keeps code clean and uniform, making it easier to understand, review, and maintain.

### Conclusion:
PHP Code Beautifier and Fixer (**phpcbf**) is a powerful tool for automatically fixing and beautifying PHP code to ensure it follows the desired coding standards. By automating the formatting and fixing of style violations, it helps developers maintain clean, readable, and consistent code, ultimately improving the quality and maintainability of PHP projects.
