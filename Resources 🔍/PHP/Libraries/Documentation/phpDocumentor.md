**phpDocumentor** is a widely used, open-source tool for generating documentation from **PHPDoc** comments in PHP source code. It reads the PHPDoc annotations and generates comprehensive and well-structured documentation in various formats (e.g., HTML, PDF, CHM, etc.), making it easier for developers to document their code and understand its structure.

### **What is phpDocumentor?**
phpDocumentor is a documentation generator that extracts PHPDoc comments from your PHP codebase and transforms them into readable and navigable API documentation. It is similar to tools like Javadoc for Java or Doxygen for C++ but is specifically designed for PHP.

By analyzing the comments in your code, phpDocumentor can automatically produce documentation that includes details about classes, methods, functions, variables, and their relationships. This is crucial for maintaining projects, collaborating with other developers, and providing clear API references.

### **Key Features of phpDocumentor**
1. **PHPDoc Parsing**:
    - phpDocumentor parses the **PHPDoc** comments in your PHP files to extract metadata about classes, methods, functions, variables, and more. It then generates structured documentation based on these comments.
2. **Automated Documentation Generation**:
    - phpDocumentor can automatically generate detailed, structured documentation in various formats. Developers don't need to manually write documentation for each part of their codebase.
3. **Output Formats**:
    - phpDocumentor supports generating documentation in different formats, including:
        - **HTML**: The most common output format, providing a well-organized and easily navigable set of web pages.
        - **PDF**: For printed documentation or offline use.
        - **CHM**: For Microsoft help files.
        - **XML**: Useful for further processing or integration with other tools.
4. **Customizable Templates**:
    - phpDocumentor allows users to customize the appearance and structure of the generated documentation using templates. You can design your documentation to suit your project's needs.
5. **Cross-referencing**:
    - The generated documentation includes cross-references, so you can easily navigate from one function to another or from a method to the class that defines it. This improves the usability of the documentation.
6. **Code Documentation for Any PHP Codebase**:
    - phpDocumentor works with any PHP project, whether itâ€™s a small script or a large framework. By following PHPDoc conventions, it can generate documentation for any well-commented PHP codebase.
7. **Supports Multiple Versions of PHP**:
    - phpDocumentor supports multiple versions of PHP, ensuring that it works with a variety of PHP projects regardless of the version.

### **Basic Usage of phpDocumentor**
To use phpDocumentor, you need to have it installed on your system. You can install phpDocumentor globally via Composer, the PHP dependency manager.

1. **Install phpDocumentor** via Composer:
    ```bash
    composer global require phpdocumentor/phpdocumentor
    ```
    
2. **Generate Documentation**:  
    After installing phpDocumentor, you can generate documentation for your PHP project by running the following command:
    ```bash
    phpdoc -d src/ -t docs/
    ```
    - `-d src/`: This option specifies the directory containing the source code to document (usually the `src` folder).
    - `-t docs/`: This option specifies the target directory where the generated documentation will be stored (in this case, the `docs` folder).
    
    phpDocumentor will scan the `src/` directory, extract PHPDoc comments from your PHP files, and generate the documentation in the `docs/` directory.

### **PHPDoc Example for phpDocumentor**
To generate proper documentation, you need to add **PHPDoc comments** to your PHP classes, functions, and methods. Here is an example of PHPDoc usage:

```php
/**
 * Class User
 *
 * This class represents a user in the system.
 *
 * @package MyApp
 */
class User
{
    /**
     * The user's name.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    private $name;

    /**
     * The user's email address.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    private $email;

    /**
     * User constructor.
     *
     * @param string $name The user's name.
     * @param string $email The user's email address.
     */
    public function __construct($name, $email)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->email = $email;
    }

    /**
     * Get the user's name.
     *
     * @return string The user's name.
     */
    public function getName()
    {
        return $this->name;
    }

    /**
     * Get the user's email.
     *
     * @return string The user's email.
     */
    public function getEmail()
    {
        return $this->email;
    }
}
```

This example will provide clear, structured documentation for the `User` class, including the constructor, properties, and methods.

### **Advanced Usage**
1. **Customizing Output Templates**:  
    phpDocumentor allows users to customize the appearance and structure of the generated documentation by using different templates. You can create custom templates or use pre-built ones.
    
    To specify a custom template:
    ```bash
    phpdoc -d src/ -t docs/ --template="myTemplate"
    ```
    
2. **Generating Documentation for Multiple Directories**:  
    You can also specify multiple directories to document by providing them as space-separated arguments:
    ```bash
    phpdoc -d src/ lib/ -t docs/
    ```
    
3. **Generating Only Specific Types of Documentation**:  
    phpDocumentor allows filtering the documentation generation by types, such as generating only class, method, or function documentation.
    
    Example:
    ```bash
    phpdoc -d src/ -t docs/ --visibility public
    ```
    
    This will only generate documentation for public classes, methods, or properties.
    
### **Benefits of Using phpDocumentor**
1. **Automated Documentation**: phpDocumentor reduces the need to manually write documentation by extracting the necessary information directly from PHPDoc comments.
2. **Improved Code Understanding**: Automatically generated documentation helps developers and users of the codebase quickly understand the functionality and structure of the code.
3. **Consistency**: By following the PHPDoc standards, phpDocumentor ensures that the generated documentation is consistent and well-organized.
4. **Integration with Development Tools**: Tools like **phpDocumentor** can be integrated into build systems or Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines to keep documentation up to date automatically whenever code changes are made.
5. **Better Collaboration**: Developers can easily share and collaborate on projects, thanks to the detailed and up-to-date documentation.

## Note 
```ad-warning
Currently, phpdoc doesn't support output directory that has space such as:
- `/Users/user/Local Sites/output`

<br>
so you'll need to use another directory that doesn't have space on it's path
```
```ad-info
you can setup an alias like so to always output to the same directory
- `alias phpdoc-default="phpdoc -d . -t /path/to/output"`
```
