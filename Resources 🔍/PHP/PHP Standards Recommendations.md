PHP Standards Recommendations (PSRs) are a set of guidelines and recommendations for PHP development, created and maintained by the PHP Framework Interoperability Group (PHP-FIG). The primary goal of PSRs is to promote interoperability and standardization among PHP components and frameworks, making it easier for developers to use code from different sources together. They cover various aspects of PHP development, including coding style, autoloader specifications, and interface definitions. Adhering to PSRs helps ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability of PHP code, leading to better collaboration and a more robust ecosystem.
