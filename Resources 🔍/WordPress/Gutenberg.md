Gutenberg is a content editor for WordPress, introduced in WordPress version 5.0 in 2018. It is a modern and intuitive block-based editor that offers a more streamlined content creation experience than the classic editor.

The Gutenberg editor is based on blocks, which are small units of content that can be individually customized and arranged on a page. Each block represents a specific type of content, such as text, images, videos, buttons, or custom blocks created by developers. Blocks can be easily added, removed, and rearranged with a drag-and-drop interface, making it easier for users to create complex layouts without needing to know HTML or CSS.

Gutenberg also offers advanced features such as inline image editing, customizable color palettes, reusable blocks, and nested blocks. Additionally, it supports third-party plugins and themes that can extend its functionality.

The goal of Gutenberg is to make content creation in WordPress easier and more intuitive, especially for users who are not familiar with HTML or CSS. With the block-based editor, users can create rich and engaging content without needing to rely on custom code or page builders.
