A must-use plugin (also called a ‘mu-plugin’) is a plugin that will always be activated by default, without you needing to do it yourself. To activate a mu-plugin, you just have to upload it in the right directory, and WordPress will automatically know that this plugin must be used. Moreover, a mu-plugin cannot be deactivated: it will always be executed, unless it is uninstalled.
