WordPress cron is a scheduling system that allows you to schedule and automate recurring tasks within your WordPress site, such as publishing scheduled posts or sending email notifications. Cron is a Unix utility that runs commands or scripts at specified intervals, and the WordPress cron system is built on top of this utility.

WordPress cron works by periodically checking a list of scheduled tasks and executing any tasks that are due to be run at that time. Tasks can be scheduled to run at specific intervals, such as every hour or every day, or at specific times, such as on a specific day of the week or month.

WordPress provides two types of cron events: "action" events and "filter" events. Action events trigger specific tasks or functions to be executed, while filter events modify data that is passed between functions.

For example, you can use WordPress cron to schedule the publishing of a post at a specific time or date, or to send a daily email summary of new posts to subscribers. You can also use cron to update plugins or themes automatically, or to clear out old database entries or cache files.

By default, WordPress uses a "pseudo-cron" system that relies on user traffic to trigger scheduled events. This means that tasks will only run if someone visits your site when the task is scheduled to run. However, you can also configure WordPress to use a "real" cron system, which uses the server's built-in cron utility to trigger scheduled events.

Overall, WordPress cron is a powerful tool that can help you automate repetitive tasks and streamline your site's workflow. It can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple content scheduling to complex data processing and analysis. [Read More](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/cron/)
