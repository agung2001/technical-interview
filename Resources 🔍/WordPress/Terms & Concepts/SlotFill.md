SlotFill is a concept related to the block editor (Gutenberg) that allows blocks or components to provide placeholder areas (slots) where other blocks or components can be inserted dynamically. It enables extensibility and flexibility by allowing developers to customize the editor UI and add additional functionality to existing blocks without modifying their core code.

The SlotFill pattern consists of two main components:
1. Slot: A defined area or placeholder within a block or component where other blocks or components can be inserted. Slots provide hooks or entry points for extending the block's functionality.
2. Fill: The content or component that fills the slot. Fills are typically other blocks or components that are inserted into the slot area of the block, adding or modifying functionality.

By using the SlotFill pattern, developers can create blocks that can be extended or enhanced with additional blocks or components. It promotes modularity and code reuse, allowing different blocks to work together and provide a richer editing experience in the block editor.

WordPress provides several SlotFill mechanisms, such as the `Slot`, `Fill`, and `SlotFillProvider` components, which can be utilized in custom block development to create extensible and customizable blocks.
