Action Scheduler is a library for triggering a WordPress hook to run at some time in the future (or as soon as possible, in the case of an async action). Each hook can be scheduled with unique data, to allow callbacks to perform operations on that data. The hook can also be scheduled to run on one or more occassions.

Think of it like an extension to do_action() which adds the ability to delay and repeat a hook.

It just so happens, this functionality also creates a robust job queue for background processing large queues of tasks in WordPress. With the addition of logging and an administration interface, it also provide tracability on your tasks processed in the background.
