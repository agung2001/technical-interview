WordPress Full Site Editing (FSE) is a major development in the WordPress ecosystem that aims to revolutionize the way users create and design their websites. It introduces a new editing experience that allows users to customize every aspect of their site, including headers, footers, sidebars, and other template parts, directly from the WordPress editor.

With Full Site Editing, users can visually design and customize their entire website using blocks and templates, without the need for custom code or third-party page builders. It provides more flexibility and control over the site's layout and design, making it easier to create unique and personalized websites.

FSE is built on the WordPress block editor, also known as Gutenberg, and is set to be a major feature in future WordPress releases, empowering users with a more intuitive and powerful website-building experience.
