WordPress media refers to all the files and assets (such as images, videos, audio files, and documents) that are uploaded and managed within the WordPress platform. The Media Library is a built-in feature in WordPress that allows users to easily upload, organize, and insert media files into posts and pages.

In the Media Library, you can view all the media files that have been uploaded to your WordPress site. Each file is represented by a thumbnail, and you can search, filter, and sort through the files for easy access. The Media Library also provides options to edit and manage media files, such as setting alt text, captions, and image sizes.

Media files play a crucial role in enhancing the visual and multimedia content of WordPress websites, making them more engaging and appealing to visitors.
