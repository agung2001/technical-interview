WordPress Multisite is a feature that allows users to create and manage multiple websites or blogs from a single WordPress installation. With WordPress Multisite, a user can create a network of sites, each with its own separate domain or subdomain, and manage them all from a single dashboard.

WordPress Multisite is useful for managing multiple websites or blogs that share the same hosting environment, as it can help to simplify site management and reduce administrative overhead. It also allows users to easily manage user accounts, themes, and plugins across multiple sites.

To set up WordPress Multisite, users must have access to a WordPress installation and be comfortable with configuring server settings and database tables. Once set up, WordPress Multisite can be managed through the WordPress dashboard, with options for creating new sites, managing users, and configuring site settings.
