## Getting Started

One of the best things about using WordPress is its customizability, there is a lot of range of support from the community. That support comes with a number range of plugins and themes that are being developed where we can pick what theme we would like to use for our website and also plugins that will empower more of our site functionality.

A WordPress theme changes the design of your website, often including its layout. Changing your theme changes how your site looks on the front-end, i.e. what a visitor sees when they browse to your site on the web. There are thousands of free WordPress themes in the WordPress.org Theme Directory, though many WordPress sites use custom themes.
