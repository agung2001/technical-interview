In WordPress, a filter is a type of hook that allows you to modify the behavior or output of a WordPress function or process by passing data through one or more functions. Filters allow you to change data at various stages of processing, such as before it is displayed on the screen or before it is saved to the database.

Filters are defined using the `add_filter()` function in WordPress, which registers a callback function to be executed when the specified filter is called. The callback function accepts one or more arguments and returns a modified value that is passed on to the next filter or to the original function.

For example, the `the_title` filter is a very common WordPress filter that allows you to modify the title of a post or page before it is displayed on the screen. A plugin or theme can register a callback function to be executed when the `the_title` filter is called using the following code:

```php
add_filter( 'the_title', 'my_custom_title' );
function my_custom_title( $title ) {
    return 'The ' . $title . ' was filtered';
}
```

In this example, `my_custom_function` is the name of the callback function that will be executed when the `the_content` filter is called. The function can modify the content of the post or page in any way, such as adding or removing HTML tags, modifying the text, or inserting additional content.

You can create your own filter by using the **apply_filters** hook. Then to execute it, you can use the **add_filter** function. This will let you hook a specific function to the filter, so you can manipulate the variable and return it. Here is the sample code :

```

// The filter callback function.
function example_callback( $string, $arg1, $arg2 ) {
    // (maybe) modify $string.
    return $string;
}
add_filter( 'example_filter', 'example_callback', 10, 3 );

/*
 * Apply the filters by calling the 'example_callback()' function
 * that's hooked onto `example_filter` above.
 *
 * - 'example_filter' is the filter hook.
 * - 'filter me' is the value being filtered.
 * - $arg1 and $arg2 are the additional arguments passed to the callback.
$value = apply_filters( 'example_filter', 'filter me', $arg1, $arg2 );
```
