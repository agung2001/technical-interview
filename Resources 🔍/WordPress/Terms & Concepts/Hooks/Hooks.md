In WordPress, hooks are a way to modify or extend the functionality of a theme or plugin without directly editing the original code. They provide a way to add custom code at specific points in the WordPress core, themes, and plugins, allowing developers to change or enhance the behavior of the software without modifying its source code.

Hooks play a crucial role in the WordPress ecosystem, as they facilitate extensibility and allow developers to build powerful and flexible themes and plugins that can be easily customized by others. They are an essential part of the WordPress architecture and are widely used throughout the platform.

Hooks come in different types which are :
- [[Action]]
- [[Filter]]
